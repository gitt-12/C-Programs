Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
    totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.
Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.
Note: Try finding out a function on the internet to do so
Input format :
Basic salary & Grade (separated by space)
Output Format :
Total Salary

int main() {
	int b,t,a;
	float h,d,p; //a->allow, d->da,h->hra,p->pf
	char g; //g->grade
	cin>>b>>g;
	if(g=='A')
	{
		a=1700;
	}
	else if(g=='B')
	{
		a=1500;
	}
	else
	{
		a=1300;
	}
	h=b*0.2;
	d=b*0.5;
	p=b*0.11;
	t=round(b+h+d+a-p);
	cout<<t<<endl;
	return 0;
}
