Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.
Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1


Input format :
Two integers x and n (separated by space)
Output Format :
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)
Constraints:
0 <= x <= 8 
0 <= n <= 9

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// Write your code here
	int x,n,i,r;
	cin>>x>>n;
	i=0;
	r=1;
	while(i!=n)
	{
       r=r*x;
	   i=i+1;
	}
	cout<<r<<endl;
}
